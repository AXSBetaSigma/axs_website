		<h3>Become a Brother</h3>
		<p>
			Pledging with AXS Beta Sigma a semester-long process, and is open to all RIT students who have taken a college chemistry class. You do not have to be a chemistry major or a master chemist to pledge - the only requirements are commitment and interest. While a lot of fun and not physically or mentally hazardous, the pledging process is intensive, and prospective pledges are warned that the process has a fairly large workload.

			Rush week of Spring 2019 is January 28th - February 3rd. Consult the <a href="events.php">Events</a> page for details on Rush Week events!
