		<h3>Become a Brother</h3>
		<p>
			Pledging with AXS Beta Sigma a semseter-long process, and is open to all RIT students who have taken a college chemistry class. You do not have to be a chemistry major or a master chemist to pledge - the only requirements are commitment and intrest. While a lot of fun and not physically or mentally hazardous, the pledging process is intensive, and prospective pledges are warned that the process has a workload roughly equivelant to a four-credit course.

			Rush week is already over for Fall 2018. We encourage you to rush next semester!
