			I am a fourth year from Edmeston, New York, planning to pursue a career in geology.  I'm very involved on campus outside of AXS; including TAing organic and analytical chemistry labs, being a student ambassador and volunteer for the College of Science, a New Student Orientation Leader for the past two years, and the president of a club.  This May I spent several weeks in Sweden studying urban ecology and sustainable development, and I hope to return to Scandinavia for graduate school following my last year at RIT.

			Hello, my name is Peyton Kunselman. I am going into my second year here at RIT. I am a Chemistry major. I pledged last semester (Spring 18). I am the new community service chair. I am currently doing research with Dr. Eddingsaas focusing on the production of Aldehydes from E-Cigarettes and Hookah. Before that, I worked on one of Dr. Craig’s projects. Other than school work, I really love to play guitar and to play video games.

			Hi! My name is Joe Discua. I’m a 5th year biochemistry major and from New Hampshire. I like long walks on the Gracie’s trail and have become a sommelier of different sodas from various vending machines. I’m from New Hampshire and enjoy hiking the presidential mountain range and exploring the wilderness. I came to RIT for the biochemistry program but stayed for the friends.

			My name is Hannah Thompson and I’m a rising 4th year studying Biomedical Engineering. I am part of a BS/MS program working towards a Masters in Science, Technology and Public Policy with an environmental focus. I hope to combine my technical knowledge with environmental awareness and consideration in my future career. I pledged the fraternity during the Spring of 2018. I’ve recently become the Public Relations Chair which I’m extremely excited about. I want to work to increase our presence on campus and develop more direct ways to connect with the community and potential members.

			I am a third year at RIT, but I’ve only been here for one year and probably won’t graduate for at least two more.  My area of interest is Genetic Engineering, and my life’s goal is to become a character in a Michael Crichton novel.  Next semester I am starting a research project on plant hormones with Dr. Coleman and Dr. Hudson.  I decided to pledge after I attended an info session for free pizza with no plans on actually joining, and it kind of got away from me.  I love the friendly, intellectual, but fun atmosphere of Alpha Chi Sigma and look forward to my first semester as a Brother.

			I am from a small town in the southern tier called Greene, NY. This is my fourth and final year at RIT, and I’ve enjoyed my time immensely, especially with AXS. I plan on going to grad school next year, we’ll see how that fairs. I enjoy reading, solving puzzles, coming up with weird ciphers, watching all sorts of interesting shows &amp; anime, music, and theater. Outside of AXS, I’m in some other cool organizations like Computer Science House, which is always u to some weird antic. I’m thrilled for the District Conclave happening the upcoming semester, always great to meet more Bros!

			I am a 3rd year Chemical Engineering major here at RIT. I hail from the town of Broadalbin, NY located in the southern portion of the Adirondack Mountains. I became a brother of Alpha Chi Sigma in the Spring of 2017. Here on campus I am a member of the 2018 Division II National Champion Roller Hockey Team. After RIT I plan to apply my studies to the brewing or metallurgy industries. Some of my hobbies include blacksmithing, hockey, running and playing squash.

			I’m a third-year undergrad in the biochem program here with plans to minor in applied statistics and hopefully go to grad school for pharmacology. I did research on targeted molecular imaging agents for early cancer detection with Dr. Hans Schmitthenner over the summer, but a 23-credit course load has kept me out of the lab for most of the semester. I’ve been part of Alpha Chi Sigma for a year now (including time spent pledging) and I can honestly say that this is my favorite conglomerate of personalities I’ve ever encountered. My favorite part of being a brother is bonding with my littles, one of whom put together this event!

Outside of pledging for Alpha Chi Sigma, he is very involved on campus; he is the treasurer of STAR (Space-Time Adventures at RIT), RIT’s Sci-fi Club as well as being the treasurer of the RIT Chapter of the American Chemical Society. He is currently between research groups, but in the past he has work with Dr. Matt Miri on fully renewable, plant based plastics, and Dr. Scott Williams on high energy radiation detectors. After RIT he plans to pursue a graduate degree and career in Astrochemistry.

			I am a second-year chemistry major, and I am minoring in environmental studies. I come all the way from Olathe, Kansas, but after a year at RIT, I can't imagine going to school anywhere else. Chemistry and environmental efforts are definitely my life, but in my free time I enjoy collecting vinyl, watching and quoting movies, drinking coffee, and being outside.
